#About the Dataset

This dataset contains information on customers who purchase clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers visit the store, have meetings with a personal stylist, and then place orders via a mobile app or website. The company aims to determine whether to focus on improving the mobile app experience or the website.
