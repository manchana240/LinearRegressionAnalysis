# E-commerce Customer Spending Analysis
# About the Dataset

This dataset contains information on customers who purchase clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers visit the store, have meetings with a personal stylist, and then place orders via a mobile app or website. The company aims to determine whether to focus on improving the mobile app experience or the website.
## Project Overview
 
This project involves:

+ Loading and exploring the dataset
+ Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
+ Building a linear regression model to predict yearly spending
+ Evaluating model performance
+ Conducting residual analysis to verify assumptions

  ## Steps

  1. Importing Necessary Libraries
  2. Loading and Exploring the Dataset
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  4. Splitting the Data for Training and Testing
  5. Building and Training a Linear Regression Model
  6. Making Predictions
  7. Evaluating Model Performance
  8. Residual Analysis

  ## Conclusion

  + EDA helps understand relationships between variables
  + Linear Regression models how different features impact yearly spending
  + Performance metrics evaluate the model's effectiveness
  + Residual analysis ensures assumptions are met

  ## final model equation would be:
  y= 35.67+ 25.73.(Avg. Session Length) + 38.62.(Time on App) + 0.57.(Time on website) + 61.27.(Length of Membership)
